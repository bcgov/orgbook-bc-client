OrgBook BC is a searchable public directory based on the latest Digital Trust technologies. It’s provided by the BC Government’s Ministry of Citizens’ Services.

Launched in January 2019, it contains British Columbia-registered organizations, as well as licenses, permits and other official data related to those organizations. You can view the [full list of data types](/about/orgbook-data) it contains.

The [Digital Trust technologies](/about/digital-trust) at the heart of OrgBook BC make it more secure and trustworthy than traditional websites. Information in OrgBook BC is highly tamper resistant, and its data sources are verified with cryptography. All its technologies are open source, meaning they’re improved and reusable by a worldwide community.

Organizations can work through a simple process to [“issue” (add) their data to OrgBook BC](/about/becoming-an-issuer). There are also developer tools available for anyone to [use OrgBook BC data](/about/orgbook-api) in their own services.

In the future OrgBook BC will enable the secure, digital sharing of trustworthy information with other organizations.
