Not finding your organization in OrgBook BC?
> 
> One reason you might not be finding the entity for which you are searching is that the organization has not been registered with BC Registries. If the organization has been registered, search for the BC Registries ID (it has a format like "FM1234567"). You can also try searching by your 9-digit Business Number from CRA, if that number is registered with BC Registries.
