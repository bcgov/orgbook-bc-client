**The Digital Trust Behind OrgBook BC**

**Our historical approach is broken**

Most websites are built using databases. People make updates to these databases by logging in with usernames and passwords.

As you’ve likely seen in the news, this approach leaves websites vulnerable to hacking, fraud, and other malicious activities. It also is symptomatic of a wider problem: identifying ourselves online, and proving where information has come from, is extremely difficult.

A new approach is needed, especially where it’s of paramount importance that people can trust information and its sources.

**Digital Trust and its benefits**

OrgBook BC uses new digital trust technologies to receive, store and display its data. Using a concept called Verifiable Credentials, data in OrgBook BC is verified using advanced cryptography and using new techniques for validating sources.

Information entering OrgBook BC—”issued” to OrgBook BC—is digitally signed by the organization that issued it. That electronic signature stays with the data throughout its life in OrgBook, and is validated before display on the website. All information is also encrypted during storage.

Most users of the OrgBook BC website won’t notice any difference from what they’re used to. They will still search and view information in the same way as on other websites. Behind the scenes, however, the processes are vastly improved.

**Where Digital Trust is going**

These Digital Trust technologies, including Verifiable Credentials, are being used in several worldwide projects. New ecosystems are emerging. OrgBook BC, with its use of these technologies, can play an active role in improving online identity and trust.
