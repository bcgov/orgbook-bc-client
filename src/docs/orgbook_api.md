**The API: Using Data From OrgBook BC**

Anyone is able to use OrgBook BC data in their own services. Rather than needing to use the OrgBook BC website interface, the data is available directly from OrgBook BC using what developers call an API. Your developers could use this, for example, to integrate OrgBook BC data into your business processes.

Developers can review the [API specification](http://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/api/) and the [API documentation](https://bcgov.github.io/orgbook-bc-api-docs/).

The data published in OrgBook BC is provided under the [Access Only Data Terms and Conditions](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/faq.html#data-publication-licensing-options---open-dataaccess-only).

If you have any questions about the API or its potential, [get in touch](/contact) with our team.
